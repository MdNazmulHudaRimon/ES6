const firstName  = "Nazmul Huda";
const  lastName  =  "Rimon";
const fullName  = firstName + ' ' + lastName + " is a good boy"; //we do this in simple js
console.log(fullName);
// but  let's how can we do this in ES6
const  fullName2 = `${firstName} ${lastName} is a good boy`; //let's see  what we get
console.log(fullName2);


// let's see how we can make  multiline using es6
const multiline = `I loved you
I missed you a lot
I cared you a lot
but you have given me continuous pain
So I decided that I dont need  you anymore
I don't want any fake love more
Thanks`;
console.log(multiline);
